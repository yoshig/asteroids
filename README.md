asteroids
=========

A simple Asteroids game made with Canvas and Javascript. Ship collisions and asteroids blowing up were done using simple geometry to determine a point of impact.

I used prototypical inheritance so that the ship, bullets, and asteroids all share some common functions, such as move, collision, and add to the canvas.

Once the screen has no more asteroids (thus the game.asteroids array is empty), the game will level up, and there will be one more asteroid to start the game than before. This is still a work in progress. Go ahead nad try it out! :)
